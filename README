Except with colors.

NetHack keys-ish. `h` and `l` for left and right, `j` and `k` for rotation.
`n` for soft drop, space for hard. `p` for pause, and `q` for quit.
Tetris-brand frustration optional, but encouraged.

This game is intentionally implemented as inefficiently as possible, because I
like it that way.
